"""
Landmark Normalization Service.

Transforms raw MediaPipe landmarks into model-ready tensors via three steps:
  1. Root-relative centering (hip midpoint at origin per frame)
  2. Scale invariance (normalize by torso length per frame)
  3. Temporal resampling (fixed-length sequence via linear interpolation)

Input:  (T, 25, 4)  — raw landmarks from extraction (x, y, z, visibility)
Output: (1, 3, T_fixed, 25) — model-ready tensor (Batch, Channels, Time, Joints)
